"""v1.0.4zd — deleting a user, settled across every reference.

USER-1 went round twice. v1.0.4zb fixed `notes.author_id`, the one reference
anybody had looked at, and closed on that evidence; five more held the
account. Deleting an established user still failed with a raw 500:

    ERROR:  update or delete on table "users" violates foreign key
            constraint "user_preferences_user_id_fkey"

The rule, settled in the release brief, is that every reference to a user is
exactly one of three kinds:

  - THEIRS ALONE      — drafts, preferences. Deleted with them.
  - A RECORD          — history, published notes, events they created.
                        Kept, with the person shown as removed.
  - A GRANT OF ACCESS — team membership, event roles. Deleted.

The central test builds the worst case and asserts each object's fate
individually. The register test below is the one that matters for next time:
it fails when the schema gains a reference to `users.id` that nobody has
classified, which is the pattern that closed the backup work.
